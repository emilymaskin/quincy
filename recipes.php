          Commander Quincy's Siberian Winter Toddy&trade; is delicious as is. Most prefer the classic, untouched flavor: 
          either served over the rocks for a cool, refreshing finish, or heated up for a deliciously cozy beverage that 
          warms even the chilliest of days.  That being said, even the Commander himself liked to mix it up every once 
          in a while.  The following are a few recipe suggestions to consider, but in the true spirit of exploration feel 
          free to experiment with your own recipes and let us know when you discover something great!
